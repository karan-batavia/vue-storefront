## Core Concepts

### What is CI/CD in Multistore?

In a multistore setup, CI/CD is designed to:
1. Automatically detect which stores have changed
2. Run tests only for affected stores
3. Build and deploy only the changed stores

This targeted approach ensures:
- Faster deployments (only changed stores are processed)
- Efficient resource usage
- Reduced redundancy (unchanged stores are skipped in CI/CD pipeline)

## Continuous Integration (CI)

Let's look at how continuous integration works in a multistore setup, using GitHub Actions as an example while explaining how to adapt each step for other CI platforms.

### 1. Setting Up Dependencies

First, we need to set up the environment. Our setup action handles several crucial steps:

::tip Why a Separate Setup Action?
We use a separate setup action to follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, as these setup steps are used in multiple workflows - for instance `continuous-integration.yml` and `continuous-deployment.yml`. However, you can include these steps directly in your workflow if you prefer - there's no technical requirement to have them as a separate action.
::

Here's how our setup action is defined:

```yaml
name: Setup repository
description: Installs all the packages and initializes environment variables

# Define required inputs for npm registry authentication
inputs:
  npm_user:
    description: Enterprise NPM registry user
    required: true
  npm_password:
    description: Enterprise NPM registry password
    required: true
  npm_email:
    description: Enterprise NPM registry email
    required: true

runs:
  using: composite
  steps:
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version-file: ./.nvmrc

    # Configure Yarn cache to speed up installations
    - name: Yarn cache
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: .yarn
        key: storefront-yarn-cache

    # Set up Turbo cache for faster builds
    - name: Cache turbo build setup
      uses: actions/cache@v4
      with:
        path: .turbo
        key: starter-turbo-${{ github.sha }}
        restore-keys: |
          starter-turbo-

    # Configure access to private npm registry
    - name: Configure NPM registry
      shell: bash
      run: |
        npm install -g npm-cli-login;
        npm-cli-login -u ${{ inputs.npm_user }} -p ${{ inputs.npm_password }} -e ${{ inputs.npm_email }} -r https://registrynpm.storefrontcloud.io || exit 1;

    # Install all project dependencies
    - name: Install dependencies
      shell: bash
      # We use frozen-lockfile to ensure consistent dependencies across all environments
      # This is important for CI/CD to avoid unexpected issues
      # We run init.mjs to ensure the project is properly initialized
      run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile --cache-folder .yarn && node init.mjs
```

And here's how we use it in our workflow:

```yaml
steps:
  # 1. Check out your code
  - name: Checkout code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
    with:
      fetch-depth: 0  # Important: Need full git history for change detection

  # 2. Set up environment using our custom action
  - name: Install dependencies
    uses: ./.github/actions/setup
    with:
      npm_user: ${{ vars.NPM_USER }}
      npm_password: ${{ secrets.NPM_PASS }}
      npm_email: ${{ vars.NPM_EMAIL }}
```

::tip Adapting for Other CI Platforms
Your CI platform needs to support: full git history access for change detection, Node.js environment setup, Yarn cache configuration, Turbo build cache setup for faster builds, and access to Alokai Enterprise Registry.
::

### 2. Change Detection

The change detection step identifies which stores have changed. Here's a simplified version of our approach:

::tip
While we recommend using change detection for efficiency, you can skip it and run actions for all stores using the `--all` flag:
```bash
# Run tests for all stores regardless of changes
yarn store test --all

# Deploy all stores
yarn store deploy --all
```
::

```yaml
name: Affected Stores
description: Determines which stores are affected

inputs:
  since:
    description: Base commit for changes
    required: false
  to:
    description: Head commit for changes
    required: false

runs:
  using: composite
  steps:
    - name: Find affected stores
      run: |
        # Basic change detection
        # Determine affected stores using the storefront CLI
        yarn store changed --condensed --since ${{ inputs.since }} --to ${{ inputs.to }} > changed_stores.json

        # Extract store IDs from the output
        STORES=$(jq -r '. | join(" ")' changed_stores.json)
        
        # Format output for CI system
        # Example: storeIds=["store1", "store2"]
        echo "storeIds=$(jq -c '.' changed_stores.json)" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
        # Example: storeIdsFlag=--store-id store1 store2
        echo "storeIdsFlag=--store-id $STORES" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
```

Important considerations when using `store changed` command:

1. `--condensed` flag prints just store IDs of changed stores. To see detailed change information in logs:
   ```bash
   # Remove --condensed flag to see why stores changed
   yarn store changed --since $SINCE_SHA --to $TO_SHA >> changed_stores.json
   echo "Changed stores report:"
   cat changed_stores.json
   ```
   Please note that as the format of the output changed, you should adjust the script to parse the store IDs from the new output.

2. Handle cases when no stores changed:
   ```bash
   if [ -z "$STORES" ]; then
     echo "No stores were affected by these changes"
     echo "storeIds=[]" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
     exit 0
   fi
   ```

3. Use correct commit references for pull requests:
   ```bash
   # Base branch commit as starting point
   --since ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
   # Branch HEAD as end point
   --to ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
   ```

### 3. Running Tests

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Run tests for affected stores
    run: |
      yarn store test --store-id $STORE_IDS
```

## Continuous Deployment (CD)

::tip
To learn how deployment works in detail, check out the [Deployment](/guides/multistore/tooling-and-concepts/deployment/deployment) guide.
::

The continuous deployment process ensures that your stores are built and deployed efficiently. Here's how it works:

### Deployment Triggers

There are several ways to configure when your stores get deployed:

#### Automatic Deployment
Deploy automatically whenever code is pushed to the main branch:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]  # Deploy on every push to main
```

#### Manual Deployment
Allow manual deployments with optional store selection:
```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      store_ids:
        description: 'Space separated list of store IDs to deploy'
        required: false  # When not provided, detect changed stores
```

You can use the automatic deployment for staging and manual deployment for production environment.

::tip Deployment Protection
For Github Actions, you can use deployment protection rules to require manual approval before deployments. Check out the Github [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs-and-deployments/managing-deployments) for more details.
::

### 1. Building and Deploying Stores

The `store deploy` command handles both building and deploying your stores. There's no need to run a separate build step:

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Deploy stores
    run: |
      yarn store deploy \
        --cloud-username ${{ vars.CLOUD_USERNAME }} \
        --cloud-password ${{ secrets.CLOUD_PASSWORD }} \
        $storeIdsFlag \
        --verbose
```

### 2. Parallel Deployment

For efficient deployment of multiple stores, use a matrix strategy:

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        store_id: ${{ fromJson(storeIds) }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy store
        run: |
          yarn store deploy \
            --cloud-username ${{ vars.CLOUD_USERNAME }} \
            --cloud-password ${{ secrets.CLOUD_PASSWORD }} \
            --store-id ${{ matrix.store_id }} \
            --verbose
```

## Advanced Topics

### Understanding Change Detection

The change detection system is a core part of our CI/CD pipeline, implemented in the CLI, with `yarn store changed` command, to ensure consistent behavior across different CI platforms. Here's how it works:

The change detection system analyzes git differences and determines which stores are affected based on several rules:

1. **Root Changes**
   When files in the base applications change (e.g., `/apps/storefront-middleware/src/index.ts`), all stores inheriting from that application are affected, unless they override the changed file.
   
   Example: A change in base middleware:
   - Changed file: `/apps/storefront-middleware/src/index.ts`
   - Affected stores: All stores which don't have their own version of the file

2. **Parent Store Changes**
   When a parent store changes, all its child stores are affected, unless they override the changed file.
   
   Example: A change in parent store:
   - Changed file: `/apps/stores/fashion-brand/middleware/index.ts`
   - Affected stores: All stores which don't have their own version of the file

3. **Direct Store Changes**
   When files within a store directory change, only that store is affected.
   
   Example: A change in specific store:
   - Changed file: `/apps/stores/sports-brand/middleware/index.ts`
   - Affected store: only `sports-brand`

4. **Dependency Changes**
   Changes to dependency files (e.g., `yarn.lock`) affect all stores.
   
   Example: A change in dependencies:
   - Changed file: `yarn.lock`
   - Affected: All stores

5. **Global Dependencies**
   Changes to globally configured paths (e.g., shared packages) affect all stores. You can mark global dependencies for the `yarn store changed` command by adding the `--global-dependencies` flag. For example:
   ```bash
   # Mark all packages in the packages directory as global dependencies
   yarn store changed --global-dependencies="packages/**"
   ```

6. **File Overrides**
   If a store overrides a file from its parent or base application, changes to the original file won't affect that store.
   
   Example: A file override:
   - Changed file: `/apps/stores/fashion-brand/middleware/index.ts`
   - Skipped: `fashion-brand-us` (has its own version of the file)
   - Affected: Other child stores without overrides

The system provides detailed information about why each store was affected:
- `STORE_CHANGED`: Direct changes to the store
- `ANCESTOR_CHANGED`: Changes in parent store or base application
- `PACKAGE_LOCK_CHANGED`: Dependency file changes
- `GLOBAL_DEPENDENCIES_CHANGED`: Changes in globally configured paths

::tip
When debugging why a particular store was affected, run the `yarn store changed` command without the `--condensed` flag to see the detailed change report. You can also run the command locally to debug the changes.
::

::info Why not use Turbo for change detection?
While Turborepo is great for monorepo task orchestration, it can't handle our dynamic store composition. Our stores are composed into the `.out` directory, which is git-ignored. Turbo relies on git history for change detection, but it can't track how these dynamically composed stores in `.out` directory change. That's why we've implemented our own change detection system that understands store inheritance and file overrides.
::

### Why Parallel Store Deployments?

We recommend running deployments in parallel (one job per store) for several reasons:

1. **Isolation**
   - Each store deployment runs in its own environment
   - Failures in one store don't affect others
   - Resource limits are per-store, preventing one store from consuming all resources

2. **Performance**
   - Multiple stores deploy simultaneously
   - Overall deployment time is significantly reduced

3. **Maintainability**
   - Easy to retry failed deployments
   - Clear logs per store
   - Simpler debugging and monitoring

### CLI-Driven Approach

Our CI/CD heavily relies on the CLI for several important reasons:

1. **Platform Independence**
   - The same commands work across all CI providers
   - No need to rewrite logic for different platforms
   - Consistent behavior everywhere

2. **Local Build and Development Parity**
   - Developers can run the same commands locally
   - Easy to debug CI/CD issues
   - No surprises between local and CI environments

3. **Encapsulated Logic**
   - Complex operations are packaged in simple commands
   - CI configuration focuses on workflow, not implementation
   - Updates to deployment logic don't require CI changes

For example, instead of implementing store change detection in CI:
```yaml
# Don't do this
- name: Detect changes
  run: |
    # Complex git diff logic
    # Parse file paths
    # Check store inheritance
    # Handle overrides
```

We use a single CLI command:
```yaml
# Do this instead
- name: Detect changes
  run: yarn store changed --since $SINCE_SHA --to $TO_SHA
```

This approach makes it easy to implement our CI/CD pipeline in any CI system that can run shell commands.
